# Contributing to @zuzak/owo

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project!
These are mostly guidelines, and not rules.
Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How to Contribute
### Reporting Bugs

We welcome reports of bugs.
We track them as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Before you file a new issue, check if there are any
[open issues](https://github.com/zuzak/owo/issues)
that already describe the problem.

You can file a new issue at https://github.com/zuzak/owo/issues/new.

### Adding New Things
#### Adding New Affixes

We encourage you to add your own prefixes and suffixes to this library.
You can do so by opening a pull request.

The primary purpose of this library is to fuel the transformations of a
Twitter bot, [@BBCBweaking](https://twitter.com/bbcbweaking).
It's therefore important to keep in mind a few guidelines for new affixes:

* they should be short (six characters is an approximate maximum)
* they should be inoffensive

#### Adding new features

You're welcome to add new features to this library!

However, bear in mind that this is a library with downstream users.
We need to be careful not to break things for people already using this library.
Try to maintain backwards compatibility if you can, but if you can't, make it clear in the pull request.
People use this library upstream for their own projects, so try not to break
backwards compatibility.

If you're adding a new transformation, think about how drastic the change is.
If it's a subtle one that downstream users might not notice, or an otherwise undramatic change, go ahead.
But if it's one an end-user might not want, hide it behind an options flag.

## Style guides
### Git commits

We try to stick to a [certain standard](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for git commit messages.
The list can be intimidating, but boils down to these three things:
* tell the computer what to do
* keep the first line succinct
* go into as much detail as needed after that

### JavaScript style

We try to follow the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) style guide for JavaScript.
If you can, keep to it -- but if you don't, don't worry.
